function classify()
%%
% This function is a place-holder for your testing code. This is not used
% by the server when validating your classifier.
%
% Since the name of this function is the same as the file-name, this
% function is called when executing classify command in the MATLAB
% given that the m-file is in the path or the current folder of MATLAB.
%
% In essence, you can use this function as a main function of your code.
% You can use this method to test code as you are implementing or
% debugging required functionalities to this file.
%
% You must not change the name of this function or the name of this file!
% However, you may add and modify the input and output variables as you
% wish to suit your needs.
%
% Typically, you could: 
% - Load the data.
% - Split the data to training and validation sets.
% - Train the classifier on the training set (call trainClassifier).
% - Test it using the validation data set and learned parameters (call
%   evaluateClassifier).
% - Calculate performance statistics (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity,
%   etc.)
%
% Based on the above procedure, you can try different approaches to find 
% out what would be the best way to implement the classifier training 
% and evaluation.
%
% You are free to remove these comments.
%
% NOTE: FILE SYSTEM COMMANDS AND/OR SYSTEM COMMANDS ARE PROHIBITED
%       ON SERVER! PLEASE REMOVE ANY SUCH COMMANDS BEFORE SUBMISSION!
%       YOU CAN E.G. DELETE/EMPTY THIS FUNCTION AS IT IS NOT USED
%       FOR TESTING ON SERVER SIDE.

%
%   samples:
%            A N-by-M data matrix. The rows represent samples and 
%            the columns features. N is the number of samples.
%            M is the number of features.
%
%            This could be e.g. the training data matrix given on the 
%            course web page or the validation data set that has been 
%            withheld for the validation on the server side.
%
%            Note: The value for N can vary! Do not hard-code it!
%
%   classes:
%
%            A N-by-1 vector of correct classes. Each row gives the correct
%            class for the corresponding data in the samples matrix.
%
% OUTPUT: 
%
%   parameters:
%            Any type of data structure supported by MATLAB. You decide!
%            You should use this to store the results of the training.
%
%            This set of parameters is given to the classifying function
%            that can operate on a completely different set of data.
%
%            For example, a classifier based on discriminant functions
%            could store here the weight vectors/matrices that define 
%            the functions. A kNN-classifier would store all the training  
%            data samples, their classification, and the value chosen 
%            for the k-parameter.
%            
%            Especially, structure arrays (keyword: struct) are useful for 
%            storing multiple parameters of different type in a single 
%            struct. Cell arrays could also be useful.
%            See MATLAB help for details on these.

%
% You must be able to construct a classifier solely based on the data in
% the parameters data structure in the evaluateClassifier-function.
% Consequently, choose carefully what is needed to be stored in the
% parameters data structure.
%
% Hint 1: If you wish to avoid overtraining, you could partition the
% training samples to a actual training data set and a testing data set
% that is used for a stopping/overtraining criterion.
%
% Hint 2: To avoid duplicating e.g. classifier construction code define
% suitable own functions at the end of this file as subfunctions!
% You could also utilize nested functions within this function
% to perform repetitive tasks. See MATLAB help for details.
